## 🧩 Project Summaries

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression Study Project
Predicts **bike rental demand** using linear regression on Kaggle’s dataset.  
Focuses on exploratory analysis and model limitations with nonlinear data.

### 2️⃣ Logistic Regression Study Project
Classifies individuals as earning **≤50K or >50K USD** using the UCI Adult dataset.  
Emphasizes **data cleaning**, encoding, and interpretability.

### 3️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Study Project
Implements a **KNN classifier** to demonstrate distance-based learning and the effect of `k` on performance.

### 4️⃣ Decision Trees & Random Forests Study Project
Classifies colleges as **Private vs. Public** using tree-based models.  
Shows how Random Forests improve generalization.

### 5️⃣ Support Vector Machines (SVM) Study Project
Predicts **loan repayment** using Lending Club data (2007–2010).  
Compares linear and nonlinear kernels for financial risk modeling.

### 6️⃣ K-Means Clustering Study Project
Clusters **red and white wines** from the UCI dataset.  
Validates clustering quality against actual labels.

### 7️⃣ Neural Networks Study Project
Trains a **Neural Network** to detect forged banknotes.  
Highlights nonlinear modeling strength and superior accuracy.
